# PrintHub â€“ Online Print Order & Management System

PrintHub is a web-based application designed to streamline and digitize the print and photocopy ordering process. This system was developed to solve real-world challenges faced by students on campus, such as long queues, unclear order statuses, and communication issues with print service providers.

  Users can track the status of their orders in real-time. Sellers can view and manage orders through a dedicated dashboard.

- **Automated Cost Calculation**  
  The system automatically calculates print costs based on document parameters and selected print options.

- **Secure File Handling**  
  Uploaded documents are securely stored in the database for easy access by sellers without physical file transfer.
